## Requirements and setup

The following items need to be setup for the Playground cluster deployment on GCP:

* [GCP account](https://cloud.google.com/) 
* [`gcloud` command-line tool](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud)
* [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) tool
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)

Authentication is required for the deployment process. `gcloud` tool can be used to log in into the GCP account:

```bash
$ gcloud auth login
```

Service account also can be used for authentication using `gcloud` cli. See more
details [here](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/auth/activate-service-account).

Prepare bucket to save terraform state , example  set  PROJECT_ID as 'apache-beam-testing'
```bash
$ gsutil mb -p ${PROJECT_ID} gs://playground-project-state
$ gsutil versioning set on gs://playground-project-state
```

## GCP infrastructure deployment

To deploy Playground infrastructure follow [README.md](./infrastructure/README.md) for infrastructure module.

## Playground application deployment

Playground requires building and pushing to registry using gradle before applying of Terraform scripts.

To build and push Playground Docker image to the [Artifact Registry](https://cloud.google.com/artifact-registry)
from Apache Beam repository root, execute the following commands:

```bash
$ cd /path/to/beam
$ ./gradlew playground dockerTagPush
```

To deploy Playground applications to Cloud App Engine see [README.md](./applications/README.md) from applications
module.

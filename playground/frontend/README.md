# Apache Beam Playground

## About

Beam Playground is an interactive environment to try out Beam transforms and examples.
The vision for the Playground is to be a web application where users can try out Beam
without having to install/initialize a Beam environment.

## Getting Started

Running, debugging, and testing all require this first step that fetches
dependencies and generates code. Run this in the Beam root:

```bash
./gradlew :playground:frontend:configure
```

### Run

See [playground/README.md](../README.md) for details on requirements and setup.

The following command is used to build and serve the frontend app locally:

```bash
flutter run -d chome
```

### Build

Run the following command to generate a release build:

```bash
flutter build web
```

This produces `build/web` directory with static files. Deploy them to your web server.

### Docker

The app is deployed to production as a Docker container.
You can also run in in Docker locally. This is useful if:

1. You do not have Flutter and do not want to install it.
2. You want to mimic the release environment in the closest way possible.

To run the frontend app with Docker, run this in the frontend directory:

```bash
docker build -t playground-frontend .
docker run -p 1234:8080 playground-frontend
```

The container sets up NGINX on port 8080.
This example exposes it as port 1234 on the host,
and the app can be served at http://localhost:1234

### Pre-commit Checks

To run all pre-commit checks, execute this in the beam root:

```bash
./gradlew :playground:frontend:precommit
```

This includes:

- Tests.
- Linter.

### Code style

Code can be automatically reformatted using:

```bash
flutter format ./lib
```

### Localization

The project is in the process of migrating from
[the built-in Flutter localization](https://docs.flutter.dev/development/accessibility-and-localization/internationalization)
to [easy_localization](https://pub.dev/packages/easy_localization).
It temporarily uses both ways.

#### Flutter Built-in Localization

To add a new localization, follow next steps:

1. Create app_YOUR_LOCALE_CODE.arb file with your key-translation pairs, except description tags, in lib/l10n directory (use app_en.arb as example).

2. Add Locale('YOUR_LOCALE_CODE') object to static const locales variable in lib/l10n/l10n.dart file.

3. Run the following command to generate a build and localization files:

```bash
flutter build web
```

#### easy_localization

To add a new localization (using `fr` as an example):

1. Create `playground_components/assets/translations/fr.yaml`.
   Fill it with content copied from an existing translation file in another language.

2. Create `assets/translations/fr.yaml`.
   Fill it with content copied from an existing translation file in another language.

3. Add the locale to the list in `lib/l10n/l10n.dart`.

### Configuration

The app could be configured using gradle task (e.g. api url)

```bash
cd beam
./gradlew :playground:frontend:createConfig
```

For more information see See [CONTRIBUTE.md](CONTRIBUTE.md)

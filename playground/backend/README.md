# Apache Beam Playground

## About

Apache Beam is an open-source, unified model for defining parallel processing pipelines for batch and streaming data.
It provides a portable API layer for building sophisticated data-parallel processing pipelines that may be executed across a diversity of execution engines, or runners.

## Getting Started

Backend development requires [Go](https://golang.org/dl/) installed (1.16 version).

The following command is used to build and serve the backend locally:

`go run main.go`

Run the following command to generate a release build file:

`go build`

Playground tests may be run using this command:

`go test`

The full list of command can be found [here](https://pkg.go.dev/cmd/go)

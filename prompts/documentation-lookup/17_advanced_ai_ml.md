Prompt:
What are AI and ML capabilities in Apache Beam?
Response:

Apache Beam has a number of built-in [AI and ML capabilities](https://beam.apache.org/documentation/ml/overview/) that enable you to:
- Process large datasets for both preprocessing and model inference.
- Conduct exploratory data analysis and smoothly scale up data pipelines in production as part of your MLOps ecosystem.
- Run your models in production with varying data loads, both in batch and streaming

For common AI Platform integration patterns in Apache Baam see [here](https://beam.apache.org/documentation/patterns/ai-platform/).

The recommended way to implement inference in Apache Beam is by using the [RunInference API](https://beam.apache.org/documentation/sdks/python-machine-learning/). See [here](https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/master/examples/notebooks/beam-ml/run_inference_pytorch_tensorflow_sklearn.ipynb) for more details of how to use RunInference for PyTorch, scikit-learn, and TensorFlow .

Using of pre-trained models in Apache Beam is also supported with [PyTorch](https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/master/examples/notebooks/beam-ml/run_inference_pytorch.ipynb), [Scikit-learn](https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/master/examples/notebooks/beam-ml/run_inference_sklearn.ipynb), and [Tensorflow](https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/master/examples/notebooks/beam-ml/run_inference_tensorflow.ipynb). Running inference on  [custom models](https://beam.apache.org/documentation/ml/about-ml/#use-custom-models) is also supported. 

Apache Beam also supports automatic model refresh, which allows you to update models, hot swapping them in a running streaming pipeline with no pause in processing the stream of data, avoiding downtime. See [here](https://beam.apache.org/documentation/ml/about-ml/#automatic-model-refresh) for more details.

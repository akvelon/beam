Prompt:
What is a pipeline development lifecycle in Apache Beam?
Response:

The Apache Beam pipeline development lifecycle is an iterative process that usually involves the following steps:

- Design your pipeline.
- Develop your pipeline code.
- Test your pipeline.
- Deploy your pipeline.

On each iteration, you may need to go back and forth between the different steps to refine your pipeline code and to fix any bugs that you find.

Desiging a pipeline addresses the following questions:
- Where my data is stored?
- What does your data look like?
- What do you want to do with your data?
- What does your output data look like, and where should it go?

Beam documentation has more information on [pipeline design](https://beam.apache.org/documentation/pipelines/design-your-pipeline/) and common [pipeline patterns](https://beam.apache.org/documentation/patterns/overview/).


Apache Beam program expresses a data processing pipeline, from start to finish. To construct a pipeline using the classes in the Beam SDKs, your program will need to perform the following general steps:

- Create a Pipeline object
- Use a Read or Create transform to create one or more PCollections for your pipeline data
- Apply transforms to each PCollection
- Write or otherwise output the final, transformed PCollections
- Run the pipeline
  
Beam documentation has more on [developing](https://beam.apache.org/documentation/programming-guide/) and [executing](https://beam.apache.org/documentation/pipelines/create-your-pipeline/) pipelines.

Testing pipelines is a particularly important step in developing an effective data processing solution. The indirect nature of the Beam model, in which your user code constructs a pipeline graph to be executed remotely, can make debugging-failed runs a non-trivial task. See [here](https://beam.apache.org/documentation/pipelines/test-your-pipeline/) for more information on pipeline testing strategies.

Choosing a [runner](https://beam.apache.org/documentation/#choosing-a-runner) is a crucial step in deploying your pipeline. The runner you choose determines where and how your pipeline will execute. 
More information on deployment is available [here](https://beam.apache.org/documentation/runtime/environments/).

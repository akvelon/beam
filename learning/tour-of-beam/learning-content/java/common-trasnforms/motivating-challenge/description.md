### Common Transforms motivating challenge
You are given a `PCollection` constructed from in-memory array of integer numbers: `[12, -34, -1, 0, 93, -66, 53, 133, -133, 6, 13, 15]`. Your task is to count how many positive even numbers and how many positive odd numbers are there. Although there are many ways how to do this try to use different transforms introduced in this module.

Please note that 0 is an even number.

Considering all of the above, in a given array you have 3 positive even numbers (12, 0 and 6) and 5 positive odd numbers (93, 53, 133, 13, 15).

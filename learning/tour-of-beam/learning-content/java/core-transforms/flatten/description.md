# Flatten

`Flatten` is a Beam transform for `PCollection` objects that store the same data type. `Flatten` merges multiple `PCollection` objects into a single logical `PCollection`.

The following example shows how to apply a `Flatten` transform to merge multiple `PCollection` objects.

```
// Flatten takes a PCollectionList of PCollection objects of a given type.
// Returns a single PCollection that contains all of the elements in the PCollection objects in that list.
PCollection<String> pc1 = ...;
PCollection<String> pc2 = ...;
PCollection<String> pc3 = ...;
PCollectionList<String> collections = PCollectionList.of(pc1).and(pc2).and(pc3);

PCollection<String> merged = collections.apply(Flatten.<String>pCollections());

```

### Data encoding in merged collections

By default, the coder for the output `PCollection` is the same as the coder for the first `PCollection` in the input `PCollectionList`. However, the input `PCollection` objects can each use different coders, as long as they all contain the same data type in your chosen language.

### Merging windowed collections

When using `Flatten` to merge `PCollection` objects that have a windowing strategy applied, all of the `PCollection` objects you want to merge must use a compatible windowing strategy and window sizing. For example, all the collections youâ€™re merging must all use (hypothetically) identical 5-minute fixed windows or 4-minute sliding windows starting every 30 seconds.

If your pipeline attempts to use `Flatten` to merge `PCollection` objects with incompatible windows, Beam generates an `IllegalStateException` error when your pipeline is constructed.

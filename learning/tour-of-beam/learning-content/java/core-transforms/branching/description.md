# Branching PCollections

It’s important to understand that transforms do not consume `PCollection`s; instead, they consider each individual element of a `PCollection` and create a new `PCollection` as output. This way, you can do different things to different elements in the same `PCollection`.

### Multiple transforms process the same PCollection

You can use the same `PCollection` as input for multiple transforms without consuming the input or altering it.

The pipeline reads its input (first names represented as strings) from a database table and creates a `PCollection` of table rows. Then, the pipeline applies multiple transforms to the same `PCollection`. Transform A extracts all the names in that `PCollection` that start with the letter ‘A’, and Transform B extracts all the names in that `PCollection` that start with the letter ‘B’. Both transforms A and B have the same input `PCollection`.

You can use two transforms applied to a single `PCollection`.

The following example code applies two transforms to a single input collection.

```
PCollection<String> dbRowCollection = ...;

PCollection<String> aCollection = dbRowCollection.apply("aTrans", ParDo.of(new DoFn<String, String>(){
  @ProcessElement
  public void processElement(ProcessContext c) {
    if(c.element().startsWith("A")){
      c.output(c.element());
    }
  }
}));

PCollection<String> bCollection = dbRowCollection.apply("bTrans", ParDo.of(new DoFn<String, String>(){
  @ProcessElement
  public void processElement(ProcessContext c) {
    if(c.element().startsWith("B")){
      c.output(c.element());
    }
  }
}));
```


### Description for example 

Accepts integers `PCollection`. Without changing it returns the new `PCollection`. In this case, one `PCollection` includes elements in multiply 5. The other `PCollection` stores multiply 10 elements.

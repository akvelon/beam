# Combine

For `Map` collection with a key (for example, using the groupByKey transformation), a common pattern is to combine a collection of values associated with each key into one combined value. Approximately it will look like this:

```
  cat, [1,5,9]
  dog, [5,2]
  and, [1,2,6]
  jump, [3]
  tree, [2]
  ...
```

In the above `PCollection`, each element has a string key (for example, “cat”) and an iterable of integers for its value (in the first element, containing [1, 5, 9]). If our pipeline’s next processing step combines the values (rather than considering them individually), you can combine the iterable of integers to create a single, merged value to be paired with each key. This pattern of a GroupByKey followed by merging the collection of values is equivalent to Beam’s `Combine` `PerKey` transform. The combine function you supply to `Combine` `PerKey` must be an associative reduction function or a subclass of `CombineFn`.

```
// PCollection is grouped by key and the Double values associated with each key are combined into a Double.
PCollection<KV<String, Double>> salesRecords = ...;
PCollection<KV<String, Double>> totalSalesPerPerson =
  salesRecords.apply(Combine.<String, Double, Double>perKey(
    new Sum.SumDoubleFn()));

// The combined value is of a different type than the original collection of values per key. PCollection has
// keys of type String and values of type Integer, and the combined value is a Double.
PCollection<KV<String, Integer>> playerAccuracy = ...;
PCollection<KV<String, Double>> avgAccuracyPerPlayer =
  playerAccuracy.apply(Combine.<String, Integer, Double>perKey(
    new MeanInts())));
```

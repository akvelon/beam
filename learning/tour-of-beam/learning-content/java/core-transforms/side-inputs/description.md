# Side inputs
In addition to the main input `PCollection`, you can provide additional inputs to a `ParDo` transform in the form of side inputs. A side input is an additional input that your DoFn can access each time it processes an element in the input PCollection. When you specify a side input, you create a view of some other data that can be read from within the ParDo transformâ€™s DoFn while processing each element.

Side inputs are useful if your `ParDo` needs to inject additional data when processing each element in the input PCollection, but the additional data needs to be determined at runtime (and not hard-coded). Such values might be determined by the input data, or depend on a different branch of your pipeline.

### Passing side inputs to ParDo

```
  // Pass side inputs to your ParDo transform by invoking .withSideInputs.
  // Inside your DoFn, access the side input by using the method DoFn.ProcessContext.sideInput.

  // The input PCollection to ParDo.
  PCollection<String> words = ...;

  // A PCollection of word lengths that we'll combine into a single value.
  PCollection<Integer> wordLengths = ...; // Singleton PCollection

  // Create a singleton PCollectionView from wordLengths using Combine.globally and View.asSingleton.
  final PCollectionView<Integer> maxWordLengthCutOffView =
     wordLengths.apply(Combine.globally(new Max.MaxIntFn()).asSingletonView());


  // Apply a ParDo that takes maxWordLengthCutOffView as a side input.
  PCollection<String> wordsBelowCutOff =
  words.apply(ParDo
      .of(new DoFn<String, String>() {
          @ProcessElement
          public void processElement(@Element String word, OutputReceiver<String> out, ProcessContext c) {
            // In our DoFn, access the side input.
            int lengthCutOff = c.sideInput(maxWordLengthCutOffView);
            if (word.length() <= lengthCutOff) {
              out.output(word);
            }
          }
      }).withSideInputs(maxWordLengthCutOffView)
  );
```

### Description for example

At the entrance we have a map whose key is the city of the country value. And we also have a `Person` structure with his name and city. We can compare cities and embed countries in `Person`.

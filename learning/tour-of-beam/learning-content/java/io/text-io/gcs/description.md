### TextIO google cloud storage file

The Apache Beam Java SDK provides a way to read and write text files from **Google Cloud Storage** (GCS) using the `TextIO` class. Here is an example of reading a text file named "**myfile.txt**" from a GCS bucket named "**mybucket**" and printing its contents:

```
Pipeline p = Pipeline.create();
p.apply(TextIO.read().from("gs://mybucket/myfile.txt"))
 .apply(ParDo.of(new DoFn<String, Void>() {
        @ProcessElement
        public void processElement(ProcessContext c) {
            System.out.println(c.element());
        }
    }));
p.run();
```

To write data to a file on GCS, you can use the write method and pass in the GCS file path as a string. Here is an example of writing a string to a text file named "**myfile.txt**" in a GCS bucket named "**mybucket**":

```
Pipeline p = Pipeline.create();
p.apply(Create.of("Hello, World!"))
 .apply(TextIO.write().to("gs://mybucket/myfile.txt"));
p.run();
```

It is important to note that in order to interact with GCS you will need to set up authentication, you can do that by setting the appropriate **GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS** environment variable or by using the `withCredentials(credentials)` method during pipeline creation.

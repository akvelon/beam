### TextIO google cloud storage file

The `TextIO` class in the Go SDK for Apache Beam provides a way to read and write text files from **Google Cloud Storage** **(GCS)** in a pipeline. To read a text file from GCS using TextIO in Go, you can use the Read method and pass in the GCS file path as a string, which starts with "**gs://**" prefix. Here is an example of reading a text file named "**myfile.txt**" from a GCS bucket named "**mybucket**" and printing its contents:

```
p := beam.NewPipeline()
lines := textio.Read(p, "gs://mybucket/myfile.txt")
beam.ParDo(p, func(line string) {
    fmt.Println(line)
}, lines)
if err := p.Run(); err != nil {
    fmt.Printf("Failed to execute job: %v", err)
}
```

To write data to a file on GCS, you can use the Write method and pass in the GCS file path as a string. Here is an example of writing a string to a text file named "**myfile.txt**" in a GCS bucket named "**mybucket**":

```
p := beam.NewPipeline()
s := beam.Create(p, "Hello, World!")
textio.Write(s, "gs://mybucket/myfile.txt")
if err := p.Run(); err != nil {
    fmt.Printf("Failed to execute job: %v", err)
}
```

It is important to note that in order to interact with GCS you will need to set up authentication, you can do that by setting the appropriate **GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS** environment variable or using the `options.WithCredentials` method during pipeline creation.

```
options := []beam.PipelineOption{
    beam.WithCredentials(creds),
}
p, err := beam.NewPipeline(options...)
```

Where `creds` is an instance of `google.Credentials`.

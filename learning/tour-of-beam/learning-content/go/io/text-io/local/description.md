### TextIO local file

Apache Beam is a programming model for data processing pipelines that can be executed on a variety of runtime environments, including **Apache Flink**, **Apache Spark**, and **Google Cloud Dataflow**. The `TextIO` class in the Go SDK for Apache Beam provides a way to read and write text files in a pipeline. To read a local file using TextIO in Go, you can use the Read method and pass in the file path as a string. Here is an example of reading a local text file named "**myfile.txt**" and printing its contents:

```
p := beam.NewPipeline()
lines := textio.Read(p, "myfile.txt")
beam.ParDo(p, func(line string) {
    fmt.Println(line)
}, lines)
if err := p.Run(); err != nil {
    fmt.Printf("Failed to execute job: %v", err)
}
```

To write data to a local file, you can use the Write method and pass in the file path as a string. Here is an example of writing a string to a local text file named "**myfile.txt**":

```
p := beam.NewPipeline()
s := beam.Create(p, "Hello, World!")
textio.Write(s, "myfile.txt")
if err := p.Run(); err != nil {
    fmt.Printf("Failed to execute job: %v", err)
}
```

It is important to note that the `Read` and `Write` methods only read and write to local file systems and not the distributed file systems like **HDFS**, **GCS**, **S3** etc.

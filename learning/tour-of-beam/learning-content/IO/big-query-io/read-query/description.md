### BigQuery reading with query

`BigQueryIO` allows you to read from a `BigQuery` table and read the results. By default, Beam invokes a `BigQuery` export request when you apply a BigQueryIO read transform. readTableRows returns a PCollection of BigQuery TableRow objects. Each element in the `PCollection` represents a single row in the table. `Integer` values in the `TableRow` objects are encoded as strings to match `BigQuery`â€™s exported JSON format. This method is convenient, but can be 2-3 times slower in performance compared to `read(SerializableFunction)`.

{{if (eq .Sdk "go")}}
```
bigquery.NewClient(context.Background(), options).Read(p,
		bigquery.Query("SELECT max_temperature FROM `tess-372508.fir.xasw`"),
		bigquery.WithCoder(bigquery.Float64()))
```
{{end}}
{{if (eq .Sdk "java")}}
```
PCollection<Double> maxTemperatures =
    p.apply(
        BigQueryIO.read(
                (SchemaAndRecord elem) -> (Double) elem.getRecord().get("max_temperature"))
            .fromQuery(
                "SELECT max_temperature FROM `tess-372508.fir.xasw`")
            .usingStandardSql()
            .withCoder(DoubleCoder.of()));
```
{{end}}
{{if (eq .Sdk "python")}}
```
lines = p | 'ReadFromBigQuery' >> beam.io.Read(beam.io.BigQuerySource(query='SELECT max_temperature FROM `tess-372508.fir.xasw`'))
```

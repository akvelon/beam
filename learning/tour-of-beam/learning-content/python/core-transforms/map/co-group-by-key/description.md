# CoGroupByKey

You can use `CoGroupByKey` relational union of two or more collections of keys/values that have the same key type.

`CoGroupByKey` accepts a dictionary of keyed `PCollections` as input. As output, `CoGroupByKey` creates a single output `PCollection` that contains one key/value tuple for each key in the input `PCollections`. Each keyâ€™s value is a dictionary that maps each tag to an iterable of the values under they key in the corresponding `PCollection`.

```
// Mock data
emails_list = [
    ('amy', 'amy@example.com'),
    ('carl', 'carl@example.com'),
    ('julia', 'julia@example.com'),
    ('carl', 'carl@email.com'),
]
phones_list = [
    ('amy', '111-222-3333'),
    ('james', '222-333-4444'),
    ('amy', '333-444-5555'),
    ('carl', '444-555-6666'),
]

// Creating PCollections
emails = p | 'CreateEmails' >> beam.Create(emails_list)
phones = p | 'CreatePhones' >> beam.Create(phones_list)


// Apply CoGroupByKey 
results = ({'emails': emails, 'phones': phones} | beam.CoGroupByKey())

def join_info(name_info):
  (name, info) = name_info
  return '%s; %s; %s' %\
      (name, sorted(info['emails']), sorted(info['phones']))

contact_lines = results | beam.Map(join_info)
```

The following code example joins the two `PCollection`s with `CoGroupByKey`, followed by a `ParDo` to consume the result. Then, the code uses tags to look up and format data from each collection.

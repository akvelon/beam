# Partition

`Partition` is a Beam transform for `PCollection` objects that store the same data type. `Partition` splits a single `PCollection` into a fixed number of smaller collections.

`Partition` divides the elements of a `PCollection` according to a partitioning function that you provide. The partitioning function contains the logic that determines how to split up the elements of the input `PCollection` into each resulting partition `PCollection`. The number of partitions must be determined at graph construction time. You can, for example, pass the number of partitions as a command-line option at runtime (which will then be used to build your pipeline graph), but you cannot determine the number of partitions in mid-pipeline (based on data calculated after your pipeline graph is constructed, for instance).

The following example divides a `PCollection` into percentile `groups.Partition`.

```
# Provide an int value with the desired number of result partitions, and a partitioning function (partition_fn in this example).
# Returns a tuple of PCollection objects containing each of the resulting partitions as individual PCollection objects.
students = ...

def partition_fn(student, num_partitions):
  return int(get_percentile(student) * num_partitions / 100)

by_decile = students | beam.Partition(partition_fn, 10)


# You can extract each partition from the tuple of PCollection objects as follows:

fortieth_percentile = by_decile[4]
```

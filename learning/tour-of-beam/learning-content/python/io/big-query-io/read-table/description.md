### BigQuery reading table

`BigQueryIO` allows you to read from a `BigQuery` table and read the results. By default, Beam invokes a `BigQuery` export request when you apply a BigQueryIO read transform. readTableRows returns a PCollection of BigQuery TableRow objects. Each element in the `PCollection` represents a single row in the table. `Integer` values in the `TableRow` objects are encoded as strings to match `BigQuery`â€™s exported JSON format. This method is convenient, but can be 2-3 times slower in performance compared to `read(SerializableFunction)`.

```
 PCollection<MyData> rows =
        pipeline
            .apply(
                "Read from BigQuery query",
                BigQueryIO.readTableRows().from("tess-372508.fir.xasw")
```

### TextIO google cloud storage file

The Apache Beam Python SDK provides a way to read and write text files from Google Cloud Storage (GCS) using the `beam.io.textio` module.

Here is an example of reading a text file named "myfile.txt" from a GCS bucket named "**mybucket**" and printing its contents:

```
import apache_beam as beam

p = beam.Pipeline()
lines = p | beam.io.ReadFromText('gs://mybucket/myfile.txt')
lines | beam.Map(print)
p.run()
```

To write data to a file on GCS, you can use the `WriteToText` `PTransform` and pass in the GCS file path as a string. Here is an example of writing a list of strings to a text file named "**myfile.txt**" in a GCS bucket named "**mybucket**":
```
import apache_beam as beam

p = beam.Pipeline()
data = ['Hello, World!', 'Apache Beam']
p | beam.Create(data) | beam.io.WriteToText('gs://mybucket/myfile.txt')
p.run()
```

It is important to note that in order to interact with **GCS** you will need to set up authentication, you can do that by setting the appropriate **GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS** environment variable or by using the with_options method during pipeline creation and passing gcp_project and `gcp_credentials` options.

```
options = PipelineOptions()
google_cloud_options = options.view_as(GoogleCloudOptions)
google_cloud_options.project = 'my-project-id'
google_cloud_options.job_name = 'myjob'
google_cloud_options.staging_location = 'gs://my-bucket/staging'
google_cloud_options.temp_location = 'gs://my-bucket/temp'
google_cloud_options.region = 'us-central1'

# set credentials
credentials = GoogleCredentials.get_application_default()
```

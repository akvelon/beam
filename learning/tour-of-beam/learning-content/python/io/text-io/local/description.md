### TextIO local file

The Apache Beam Python SDK provides a way to read and write text files using the `beam.io.textio` module.

Here is an example of reading a local text file named "**myfile.txt**" and printing its contents:

```
import apache_beam as beam

p = beam.Pipeline()
lines = p | beam.io.ReadFromText('myfile.txt')
lines | beam.Map(print)
p.run()
```

To write data to a local file, you can use the `WriteToText` `PTransform` and pass in the file path as a string. Here is an example of writing a list of strings to a local text file named "**myfile.txt**":

```
import apache_beam as beam

p = beam.Pipeline()
data = ['Hello, World!', 'Apache Beam']
p | beam.Create(data) | beam.io.WriteToText('myfile.txt')
p.run()
```

It is important to note that the from and to methods only read and write to local file systems and not the distributed file systems like `HDFS`, `GCS`, `S3` etc.

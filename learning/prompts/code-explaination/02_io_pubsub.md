Prompt:
What does this code do?
```python
pipeline_options = PipelineOptions(pipeline_args)

with beam.Pipeline(options=options) as p:
    (p | "Read" >> ReadFromPubSub(subscription=input_subscription)
       | "Process" >> ParDo(ProcessMessage())
       | "Write" >> WriteToPubSub(topic=output_topic))
```

Response:
This code reads messages from a [PubSub](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub) subscription `input_subscription` using the `ReadFromPubSub`, processes them and writes the resulting collection to a PubSub topic `output_topic` using the `WriteToPubSub` transform.

PubSub currently supported only in streaming pipelines.

Reading messages directly from a topic is also supported. In this case a temporary subscription will be created automatically.

`ReadFromPubSub` produces a `PCollection` of `PubsubMessage` objects or a `PCollection` of byte sequences. Behavior is controlled by the `with_attributes` parameter with byte sequences being the default.
For more on PCollections see the [Beam Programming Guide](https://beam.apache.org/documentation/basics/#pcollection).

Processing of the messages is done by the `ProcessMessage` class. This class is a subclass of the `DoFn` class.
Simplest implementation of ProcessMesageclass could be something like:

```python
class ProcessMessage(beam.DoFn):
    def process(self, element):
        yield element
```
More on `DoFn` class can be found [here](https://beam.apache.org/documentation/programming-guide/#dofn).

See [PubSub IO](https://beam.apache.org/releases/pydoc/current/apache_beam.io.gcp.pubsub.html) transform documentation for more details.

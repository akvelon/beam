Prompt: How to reduce payload when calling external services from my Apache Beam pipeline?

Response:
To reduce payload when calling external services from your Apache Beam pipeline, you can employ batching techniques by using the `GroupIntoBatches` transform. Batching involves aggregating multiple elements into a single payload, reducing the number of requests sent to the external service and minimizing overhead.

Under the hood, the `GroupIntoBatches` transform utilizes [state and timers](https://beam.apache.org/documentation/programming-guide/#state-and-timers) to grant users precise control over batch size and buffering duration parameters, while abstracting away the implementation details. Key parameters include:
* `maxBufferDuration`: controls the maximum waiting time for a batch to be emitted.
* `batchSize`: determines the maximum number of elements in each batch. Elements are buffered until the specified number is reached, then emitted as a batch.
* `batchSizeBytes` (Java only): limits the byte size of a single batch, determined by the input coder.
* `elementByteSize` (Java only): sets the byte size of a single batch using a user-defined function.
* `withShardedKey()`: enhances parallelism by distributing a single key across multiple threads.

The following sample code snippets illustrate the use of `GroupIntoBatches` to batch elements in an Apache Beam pipeline in Java and Python.

Java:

```java
public class GroupIntoBatchesExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create PipelineOptions
        PipelineOptions options = PipelineOptionsFactory.create();
        // Create Pipeline
        Pipeline pipeline = Pipeline.create(options);

        pipeline
            // Read input data from a text file
            .apply("Read Input", TextIO.read().from("input.txt"))
            // Add a key to each input element
            .apply("Add Key", MapElements.via(new SerializableFunction<String, KV<String, String>>() {
                public KV<String, String> apply(String input) {
                    // Map each input element to a (key, value) pair
                    return KV.of("key", input);
                }
            }))
            // Group elements into batches
            .apply("Group Into Batches", GroupIntoBatches.ofSize(100)
                // Specify maximum buffering duration for batching
                .withMaxBufferingDuration(Duration.standardSeconds(60))
                // Enable sharded keys for improved parallelism
                .withShardedKey())
            // Write the batched output to a text file
            .apply("Write Output", TextIO.write().to("output.txt").withoutSharding());
    }
}
```

Python:

```python
def main():
    with beam.Pipeline() as pipeline:
        # Read input data from a text file
        input_data = pipeline | "Read Input" >> beam.io.ReadFromText("input.txt")

        # Transform elements into (key, value) pairs with a key assigned to each element
        keyed_data = input_data | "Add Key" >> beam.Map(lambda x: ('key', x))

        # Apply GroupIntoBatches with options
        batched_data = (
            keyed_data
            | "Group Into Batches"
            >> beam.GroupIntoBatches(
                # Specify max duration for buffering elements before emitting batches
                max_buffering_duration=60,  # 60 seconds
                # Specify the maximum number of elements in each batch
                batch_size=100,
                # Shard keys to distribute batches evenly across workers
                with_sharded_key=True
            )
        )

        # Print the results
        batched_data | "Write Output" >> beam.io.WriteToText("output.txt", shard_name_template="")
```

By employing these transforms, you can efficiently process batches of elements in bulks, reducing the overhead in your pipeline when making external API calls.

When grouping elements into batches, keep in mind the following considerations:
* Batches exclusively contain elements with the same key.
* Batches retain elements from the same window, preserving windowing logic.
* A batch might encompass elements from more than one bundle.

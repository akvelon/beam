Prompt:
How can I use Apache Beam in my AI/ML pipeline?

Response:
You can use Apache Beam for data ingestion, validation, preprocessing, and inference.

Apache Beam offers a rich set of [I/O connectors](https://beam.apache.org/documentation/io/connectors/) and [transforms](https://beam.apache.org/documentation/transforms/python/) that allow for reading and writing data from and to various data sources and sinks, as well as performing data validation.

For data preprocessing, Apache Beam provides the [MLTransform](https://beam.apache.org/documentation/ml/preprocess-data/) class. This feature allows you to ensure data consistency by applying the same preprocessing steps for both training and inference.

Additionally, Apache Beam allows integration with pre-trained models from [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/), [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/), and [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/).

To execute machine learning inference tasks, Apache Beam provides the RunInference API.
[`RunInference`](https://beam.apache.org/documentation/transforms/python/elementwise/runinference/) is a [`PTransform`](https://beam.apache.org/documentation/basics/#ptransform) that supports the usage of any custom models. For an example of running inference on a custom model loaded with [spaCy](https://spacy.io/), refer to the [Bring your own ML model to Beam RunInference](https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/master/examples/notebooks/beam-ml/run_custom_inference.ipynb) example in the Apache Beam GitHub repository.

The `RunInference` transform efficiently handles models of any size, making it suitable for large language models (LLMs) and other complex architectures. You can find an example of deploying and performing inference on large language models (LLMs) in the [RunInference](https://beam.apache.org/documentation/transforms/python/elementwise/runinference/) section of the Apache Beam documentation.

Prompt:
How can I run inference on a trained model using AI?
Response:
Apache Beam lets you efficiently inference on local and remnote ML models in your pipelines with the help of `RunInference API` which is supported in Python SDK starting from Apache Beam 2.40.0 and in Java SDK version 2.41.0 through Apache Beamâ€™s [Multi-language Pipelines framework](https://beam.apache.org/documentation/programming-guide/#multi-language-pipelines). A `RunInference` transform performs inference on a `PCollection` of examples using a machine learning (ML) model. The transform outputs a `PCollection` that contains the input examples and output predictions. 

`RunInference API` has includes following features:
- support of both batch and streaming inference
- centralized model management fot efficient memory and bandwidth usage
- support of multiple model frameworks and model hubs
- automatic model refresh ensures latest model version is used
- support of GPUs for model inference

`RunInference API` supports variety of frameworks and model hubs iuncluding [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/), [Sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/), [XGBoost](https://xgboost.ai/), [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/), [TensorFlow Hub](https://www.tensorflow.org/hub), [Vertex AI](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai), [TensorRT](https://developer.nvidia.com/tensorrt), and [ONNX](https://onnx.ai/). You can also use custom model frameworks by using a custom [model_handler](https://beam.apache.org/documentation/ml/about-ml/#use-custom-models).

To import models you need to configure the a `ModelHandler` object that wraps the underlying model. The `ModelHandler` allows you to set environment variables needed for inference.

Following is an example importing a model handler to use in your pipeline:

```python
from apache_beam.ml.inference.pytorch_inference import PytorchModelHandlerTensor
from apache_beam.ml.inference.base import RunInference

  model_handler = PytorchModelHandlerTensor(
    # model handler setup
  )

with pipeline as p:
    predictions = p |  'Read' >> beam.ReadFromSource('a_source')
                    | 'RunInference' >> RunInference(model_handler)
```

See [here](https://github.com/apache/beam/tree/master/sdks/python/apache_beam/examples/inference) for end-to-end examples for supported model frameworks and model hubs.

If you would like to run inference on a model that is not specifically supported, you need to create your own `ModelHandler` or `KeyedModelHandler` with logic to load your model and use it to run the inference. See here example of [custom model handler](https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/master/examples/notebooks/beam-ml/run_custom_inference.ipynb).

For patterns and best practises of running inference with Apache Beam, see [here](https://beam.apache.org/documentation/ml/about-ml/#runinference-patterns).

For an example of using RunInference API in Java SDK see [here](https://github.com/apache/beam/tree/master/examples/multi-languages). Additionally see [Using RunInference from Java SDK](https://beam.apache.org/documentation/ml/multi-language-inference/) for an example of a composite Python transform that uses the RunInference API along with preprocessing and postprocessing from a Beam Java SDK pipeline.

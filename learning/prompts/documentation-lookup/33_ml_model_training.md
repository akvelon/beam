Prompt:
How can I use Apache Beam in AI/ML pipeline?
Response:
You can use Apache Beam for data ingestion, validation, preprocessing, model validation, and model deployment and inference.

Apache Beam has a rich set of  [I/O connectors](https://beam.apache.org/documentation/io/connectors/) and [transforms](https://beam.apache.org/documentation/transforms/python/) which allow to read and write data from/to various data sources and perform data validation.

Apache Beam also has a [MLTransform](https://beam.apache.org/documentation/ml/preprocess-data/) for preprocessing data. This allows you to ensure data consistency using same steps for training and inference.

Apache Beam allows using pre-trained models with [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/), [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/), and [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/).

Machine learning inference can be performed in Apache Beam using the `RunInference API`.
[RunInference](https://beam.apache.org/documentation/transforms/python/elementwise/runinference/) transform supports usage of any custom models. See [here](https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/master/examples/notebooks/beam-ml/run_custom_inference.ipynb) for an example of running inference on a model loaded with [spaCy](https://spacy.io/).

RunInference works well on arbitrary large models. See [here](https://beam.apache.org/documentation/transforms/python/elementwise/runinference/) for example of deployment and inference on LLM.

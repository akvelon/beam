Prompt:
How can I orchestrate Apache Beam pipelines with TFX?
Response:
Apache Beam is an open source, unified programming model for defining both batch and streaming data-parallel processing pipelines.Each Apache Beam pipeline is a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) of data processing operations constructed using Apache Beam SDK in one of the [supported languages](https://beam.apache.org/documentation/sdks/java/).
To run a pipeline you need to deploy it to one of the supported [Beam runners](https://beam.apache.org/documentation/runners/capability-matrix/).
You can use Apache Beam for various tasks within your machine learning project, including data validation, preprocessing, model validation, and model deployment and inference.
However, a comprehensive ML workflow also involves additional steps like data exploration, feature engineering, and model training. Additionally, ML workflows require metadata and artifact tracking for reproducibility and auditability. Popular tools for building and managing ML workflows include [KubeFlow](https://www.kubeflow.org/), [TFX](https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx), and [Apache Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/).

TFX is an end-to-end platform for deploying production ML pipelines. TFX pipelines are a sequence of components that implement an ML pipeline. TFX pipeline DAG needs an orchestrator of it's own. Natively supported orchestrators include [Kubeflow Pipelines](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/components/pipelines/), [Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/), and Apache Beam itself.

In order to run an Apache Beam pipeline as part of a TFX pipeline you need to:
1. Create TFX components by specifying interfaces and containerizing the component implementation.
2. Create TFX pipeline by connecting components, and defining how inputs and outputs are passed between the components.
3. Compile and run TFX pipeline in the target environment.

TFX has a rich set of [standard components](https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx/guide#tfx_standard_components) for building ML pipelines. These components can be used as building blocks for creating custom components. TFX relies heavily on Apache Beam libraries to implement data-parallel pipelines in these components. You need to run components created with these libraries with one of the supported Apache Beam runners.

To launch the pipeline, two configurations must be provided - orchestrator for the TFX pipeline and the pipeline options to run Apache Beam pipelines.

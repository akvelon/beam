Prompt:
How can I use custom remote inference calls in my Apache Beam pipeline?

Response:
The preferred way to run inference in an Apache Beam pipeline is to use the [RunInference API](https://beam.apache.org/releases/pydoc/current/apache_beam.ml.inference.html#apache_beam.ml.inference.RunInference) provided by the Apache Beam SDK. It enables you to run models as part of your pipeline or perform remote inference calls.

You have to consider following factors while developing custom inference calls:
- **API quotas**: heavy load might result in API quota limits being reached. You may use [PipelineOptions](https://beam.apache.org/documentation/programming-guide/#configuring-pipeline-options) to set the maximum number of parallel API calls. Use direct_num_workers pipeline option for [Direct Runner](https://beam.apache.org/documentation/runners/direct/) or max_num_workers for [Google Cloud Dataflow Runner](https://beam.apache.org/documentation/runners/dataflow/). See [Beam capability matrix](https://beam.apache.org/documentation/runners/capability-matrix/) for information about other runners.
- **Error handling**: you need to handle errors in case of API call failures. You may use exponential backoff for retries or dead-letter queues for failed API calls.
- **Monitoring**: use monitoring and performance metrics to track the performance of your inference calls and health of your pipeline.
- **Batching**: you may use batching to send multiple inputs in a single API call for efficiency.

You will need to create a `beam.DoFn` in the form of custom model handler in order to make external API calls with `RunInference` `Ptransform`:

```python
class CustomModelHandler(ModelHandler):
  """DoFn that accepts a batch of inputs and sends that batch to the remote API for inference"""
  
  def load_model(self):
    """Initiate the Custom remote API client."""
    client = ... # Initialize the client
    return client

  def run_inference(self, batch, model, inference):

    # Prepare a batch request for all inputs in the batch.
    inputs = ... # process inputs from the batch
    input_requests = ... # Prepare input requests for the model
    batch_request = ... # Prepare batch request for the model

    # Send the batch request to the remote endpoint.
    responses = model.(request=batch_request).responses

    return responses
```
Use this custom model handler in your pipeline as follows:
```python

with beam.Pipeline() as pipeline:
  _ = (pipeline | "Create inputs" >> beam.Create(<read input data>)
                | "Inference" >> RunInference(model_handler=CustomModelHandler())
                | "Process outputs" >> beam.Map(<write output data>)
  )
```

For a complete example of using the `RunInference API` for remote inference calls, see the [here](https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/master/examples/notebooks/beam-ml/custom_remote_inference.ipynb).

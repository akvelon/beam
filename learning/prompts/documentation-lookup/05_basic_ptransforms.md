Prompt:
What is a PTransform in Apache Beam?
Response:

A [PTransform](https://beam.apache.org/documentation/programming-guide/#transforms) (or Transform) represents a data processing operation, or a step, in a Beam pipeline. A transform is applied to zero or more PCollection objects and produces zero or more PCollection objects.

Key Transforms Characteristics
1. Versatility: Able to execute a diverse range of operations on PCollections.
2. Composability: Can be combined to form elaborate data processing pipelines.
3. Parallel Execution: Designed for distributed processing, allowing simultaneous execution across multiple workers.
4. Scalability: Apt for handling extensive data, suitable for both batch and streaming data.

The Beam SDKs contain a number of different transforms that you can apply to your pipeline’s PCollections. Common transform types include:
 - [Source transforms](https://beam.apache.org/documentation/programming-guide/#pipeline-io) such as TextIO.Read and Create. A source transform conceptually has no input.
 - [Processing and conversion operations](https://beam.apache.org/documentation/programming-guide/#core-beam-transforms) such as ParDo, GroupByKey, CoGroupByKey, Combine, and Count.
 - [Outputting transforms](https://beam.apache.org/documentation/programming-guide/#pipeline-io) such as TextIO.Write.
 - User-defined, application-specific [composite transforms](https://beam.apache.org/documentation/programming-guide/#composite-transforms).

Transform processing logic is provided in the form of a function object (colloquially referred to as “user code”), and this code is applied to each element of the input PCollection (or more than one PCollection). They can be linked together to create complex data processing sequences.
User code for transforms should satisfy the [requirements of the Beam model](https://beam.apache.org/documentation/programming-guide/#requirements-for-writing-user-code-for-beam-transforms).

```python
import apache_beam as beam

with beam.Pipeline() as pipeline:
    input_collection = pipeline | beam.Create([...])
    output_collection = input_collection | beam.ParDo(SomeUserCode())
```
